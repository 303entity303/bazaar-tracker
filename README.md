# Hypixel Bazaar Price Predictor 🧮📈

This Python project predicts future Hypixel Bazaar prices based on historical data collected from the official API.  
It includes a script that fetches current Bazaar prices every 20 seconds and another that uses the collected data to forecast future item prices.

The script is designed to be easy to use even for non-expert users — just follow the setup instructions and you're ready to go!

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Install dependencies with:
  pip install pandas numpy requests psutil pmdarima statsmodels

 📁 Data Storage

Price history is saved locally in the `prices/` folder.  
It is recommended to start the data fetcher some time **before** making predictions, so the script can collect enough historical data.  
The longer the fetcher runs, the more data is collected, and the more accurate the predictions will be.

Depending on how long you keep the fetcher running, it may use several hundred MB to a few GB of disk space per day.

🚀 How to Use

Run the predictor script like this:

python predictor.py <buy/sell> <ITEM_NAME> <NUMBER> <time> <s/m/h/d> 

Example:

python predictor.py buy ENCHANTED_DIAMOND 30 m 

To stop the background data fetcher, run:

python predictor.py --stop_fetcher
