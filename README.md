# Hypixel Bazaar Price Predictor 🧮📈

This Python project predicts future Hypixel Bazaar prices based on historical data collected from the official API.  
It includes a script that fetches current Bazaar prices every 20 seconds and another that uses the collected data to forecast future item prices.

The script is designed to be easy to use even for non-expert users — just follow the setup instructions and you're ready to go!

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- A valid Hypixel API key (you can generate one [here](developer.hypixel.net))  
- Install dependencies with:
  pip install pandas numpy requests psutil pmdarima statsmodels

🔐 API Key

When you run the script for the first time, it will ask for your Hypixel API key and save it locally in config.json.
The key is used only to fetch public Bazaar data.

📁 Data Storage

Price history is saved locally in the prices/ folder.
Depending on how long you keep the fetcher running, it may use several hundred MB to a few GB of disk space per day.

🚀 How to Use

Run the predictor script like this:

python script.py <buy/sell> <ITEM_NAME> <NUMBER> <s/m/h/d> 

Example:

python script.py buy ENCHANTED_DIAMOND 30 m 

To stop the background data fetcher, run:

python script.py --stop_fetcher
